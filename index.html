        <h1>Colin Reavis</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Colin, and I have survived 25 trips around the sun. Some of my favorite things in life are good food, good company, and good music.
            As a child, I wanted to be an astronaut, my major in college was psychology, and now I am learning to code. Hopefully this is the field that sticks,
            because I am quite tired of changing directions. So far, programming seems right up my alley - I think I have the problem-solving mindset everyone
            says helps, and I love the small boost of dopamine after finally getting something right after an afternoon of working at it.
            So far, SQL has been my favorite lesson but I can see how important knowledge of C# is. I am consistently surprised by the amount of progress I have made
            in the past six weeks in this bootcamp, as I can look through my notes and find things I was freaking out about have since become trivial. I hope I can
            maintain my focus and keep at this until it's my career!

            I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
            <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
            his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a <em>beautiful</em> smile. "Why
            would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
